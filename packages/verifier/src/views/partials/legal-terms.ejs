      This Verite Credential Acceptance Agreement (this “Agreement”) is a
      contract between you (“you” or a “User”) and Circle Internet Group,
      LLC (“Circle,” “we,” or “us”) that applies to your acceptance of a Verite
      Decentralized Identity Credential (“Verite Credential’) that was issued by
      Circle. From and after the date set forth above, this Agreement shall
      govern your acceptance of any Verite Credential issued by Circle.

        Circle may, at its sole and absolute discretion, issue Verite
        Credentials to cryptocurrency wallets used and controlled by Circle
        Account Customers or other individuals or entities(“Credential
        Holders”). Verite Credentials provide secure, portable,
        privacy-preserving digital identity attestations. Verite Credentials are
        intended to attest that Circle has checked that such Credential Holder
        has been evaluated for purposes of meeting a certain standard (the
        “Verite Credential Service”). For example, a Verite Credential may
        indicate that Circle has successfully conducted a Know Your Business
        (“KYB”) check upon a Credential Holder. Circle may issue credentials
        verifying other information about a Credential Holder in the future at
        its sole and absolute discretion. A list of the types of Verite
        Credentials issued by Circle and information on what they attest to is
        available
        <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/verite" target="_blank">here.</a> You
        are solely responsible for reading and understanding what a particular
        Verite Credential attests to.

        >
        Verite is a set of open-source, decentralized identity protocols that
        were developed by the Centre Consortium (now Circle). By accepting a Verite
        Credential, you are agreeing to the Verite software license agreement
        available
        <a

        >
        Circle issues Verite Credentials on an open-sourced and decentralized
        basis. It does not control whether or not a given business,
        decentralized protocol, or other third-party will choose to accept a
        particular Verite Credential or whether any User is in compliance with
        any applicable law, statute, ordinance, rule or regulation in connection
        with any use of, or reliance on, any Verite Credential. You are solely
        responsible for determining whether requiring your customers, business
        partners, or other third parties you interact to have a particular
        Verite Credential will make your business compliant with any applicable
        law, statute, ordinance, rule, or regulation. Circle makes no
        representations or warranties regarding whether use of or acceptance of
        a Verite Credential will satisfy any applicable law, statute, ordinance,
        rule or regulation.

        By issuing a Verite Credential, Circle is not providing legal,
        accounting, or other professional services or a legal, accounting or
        other professional opinion. You will not request, and you acknowledge
        you are not receiving, any legal, accounting or other professional
        advice by utilizing a Verite Credential as part of your business. You
        agree that it is your responsibility to consult with independent legal
        counsel regarding your use of the Verite Credential Service.

        Should you choose to use a Verite Credential in connection with your
        business, you hereby agree that you will not:
        <div>
          <ol>
            <li>
              violate (or assist any other party in violating) any applicable

        >
        Credential Holders who Circle has determined have met certain standards,
        such as passing a KYB check or establishing their status as an
        accredited investor, may add a Verite Credential attesting to this
        status to a cryptocurrency wallet that such Credential Holder controls.
        Circle is unable to verify that such a Credential Holder continues to
        control such a cryptocurrency wallet after the Verite Credential has
        been issued. Circle cannot guarantee that a wallet with a Verite
        Credential has not been lost, hacked or is otherwise under the control
        of another party. Circle shall have no responsibility should a
        third-party party obtain control over such a cryptocurrency wallet with
        a Verite Credential.

        Circle may offer a service that permits you to check the status and
        validity of a particular Verite Credential (“Credential Verification
        Service”). Notwithstanding any third party terms to the contrary, it is
        solely your responsibility to use this service before engaging with a

        Verite is a set of open-source, decentralized identity protocols that
        were developed by the Centre Consortium (now Circle). Given Verite’s open source
        nature, any party may issue a credential based on its own standards and
        criteria. Circle has no responsibility for credentials issued by other
        parties.

        Verite Credential to its Customer, Circle is attesting, to the best of

        that any particular credential is valid.

        From time to time, Circle may revoke a Verite Credential that it has
        issued via the Credential Verification Service described in Section 7.
        Similarly, Verite Credentials are set to expire after an appropriate
        period of time based on the nature of the specific type of Verite
        Credential. It is solely your responsibility to utilize and monitor the
        Credential Verification Service so that you know when a credential has

        <span class="legal-terms-text-item">Arbitration.</span> Except for
        claims for injunctive or equitable relief and not on a class-wide or
        representative basis, any dispute between you and Circle related in any
        way to, or arising in any way from, the Verite Credential Service or
        this Agreement (“Dispute”) shall be finally settled on an individual,
        non-representative basis in binding arbitration in accordance with the
        Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS (available from
        JAMS on its website at www.jams.com), as modified by this Agreement, or
        in accordance with rules on which we may mutually agree in writing;
        provided, however, that to the extent a Dispute is within the scope of a
        small claims court’s jurisdiction, either you or Circle may commence an
        action in small claims court, in the county of your most recent physical
        address, to resolve the Dispute.

        <p>
          Any arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and
          shall take place in the US county of your most recent physical address
          or, if there is no such US county, in Suffolk County, Massachusetts,
          USA. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent
          jurisdiction could award, including attorneys’ fees when authorized by
          law. The arbitral decision may be enforced in any court of competent
          jurisdiction. An arbitral decision is subject to very limited review
          by a court. This Agreement evidences a transaction involving
          interstate commerce, and therefore, the Federal Arbitration Act
          (“FAA”) applies to this Agreement, including the agreement to
          arbitrate set forth in this Section 15. We each agree that the FAA,
          and not state law, shall govern whether a Dispute is subject to
          arbitration.
